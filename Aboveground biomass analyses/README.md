## Folder and code content
In this folder are provided the datasets used in [publication].
Analyses of the aboveground biomass are described in the code. Specifically, are present:
- Linear Mixed Models (LMMs)
- Generalised Least Square Models (GLS)
These are calculated for the biomass of trees obtained from the equation of Chave et al. (2005,2014), with and without the consideration of height (see [publication] for details on calculations and related methodology).
In addition, LMMs and GLS are calculated for the aboveground biomass calculated through Chave et al. (2014) but without the consideration of dead trees.
