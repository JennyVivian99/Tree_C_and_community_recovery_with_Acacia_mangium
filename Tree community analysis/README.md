## Folder and code content
In this folder are provided the datasets used in [publication].
Analyses of the tree community are described in the code. Specifically, are present:
- PerMANOVA
- NMDS plot
- Indicspecies (dominant species) and simpler analysis (contribution of each species to tree community composition)
- Gamma diversity exploration through iNEXT
- Hill's number calculation
- Diversity indexes calculations (richness, Shannon, Simpson)
- Linear correlation between Simpson (from Hill's numbers) and richness
- Pielou index
- Chao indexes (Chao1 and Chao2)
- Native and exotic species analyses (through LMM and GLS)
- Native and exotic species proportions analyses (through LMM)
- Plots creation
